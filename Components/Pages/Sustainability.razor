                At PreSIZEly, we are committed to promoting sustainability in fashion e-commerce.
                Online returns contribute significantly to carbon emissions, packaging waste, and unnecessary transportation.
                Our platform addresses this challenge by encouraging accurate purchases and reducing over-consumption.
            </p>
            <p>
                According to research, online returns contribute to 30% additional carbon emissions for each return.
                By implementing a size calculator, we aim to minimize this impact and align with environmental conservation efforts.

        <h2>Return Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We believe in creating a sustainable shopping experience for our customers. Our return policy is designed to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Encourage accurate purchases with the use of the size calculator.</li>
            <li>Reduce unnecessary returns and their associated environmental costs.</li>
            <li>Support customers in making informed decisions through clear size guidance and recommendations.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Returns are accepted within 14 days of purchase for items in their original condition. However, we urge our
            customers to leverage the size calculator to ensure the right fit and minimize the need for returns.

        <ul>
            <li>Help customers find their perfect fit by providing size recommendations based on their measurements.</li>
            <li>Reduce the frustration and hassle of returns, building trust with our customers.</li>
            <li>Support small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) by offering a cost-effective, scalable solution.</li>
